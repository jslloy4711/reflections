What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Initializing creates a .git folder to keep track of revisions

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The repository holds any committed files. The files are sent to the staging area first as a holding place before actually committing them. The value is in being able to see what files you will modify when committing and not committing all the files at once.
