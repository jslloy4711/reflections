When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When collaborating or using multiple pcs.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because you might be in the middle of changes and pull them in that momemnt on instability.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of the other?

Clones are on the local machine, either when copying directly on the local machine or from a GitHub repo to your local machine. Branches are creating new lines in the logical choices. It creates a copy, but does not edit the master branch. Forks are copies of repos done soley on GitHub.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

It provides the ability to see changes made by other people and even offline tells you if you are up to date or not.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

I would have to interact one on one with the other people. That would be easier to work out issues quicker, but also inconvenient at times when they are unavailable to work on a project.
